		<p>
			These simulations are being rendered using individual HTML elements with CSS translations, and they're very
			easy to include in a web page, just include the script and create a boundary for the boids to work in.
			They'll even follow your mouse if you move it around near them. Lets take a look at what's going on behind
			the scenes to create this flocking behaviour:
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>
			Bounding
		</h3>
		<p>
			Each boid starts in a random place, with a random velocity. In this example with just one boid, it will just
			carry on with the same velocity until it gets close to the edge of the region it's in. At this point it's
			velocity will be nudged in the opposite direction in proportion to how close it is to the boundary, stopping
			it from just flying off the screen at the first opportunity.
		</p>
		<div id="boidsDiv" class="1,ignore-mouse,no-colour,show-boundaries"
			style="height: 15vh; margin: auto; overflow: hidden; padding: 0;"></div>
		<br>
		<h3>
			Attraction
		</h3>
		<p>
			Each boid is setup with a maximum visual range, and each boid can only see other boids within this visual
			range. Put another way, if you imagine a circle drawn round each boid, it can only see other boids within
			its circle. This part is by far the most computationaly intensive as for each boid, we much calculate the
			distance to every other boid in order to know which other boids are within it's vision.
		</p>
		<div id="boidsDiv" class="3,ignore-mouse,debug-colour,hide-boundaries"
			style="height: 15vh; margin: auto; overflow: hidden; padding: 0;"></div>
		<p>
			<b><em>Boring computer science interjection</em></b> Imagine a boid with 3 other boids around it. To
			calculate whether any of those are within it's vision, we have 3 distance measurements to take. Then when we
			do the same with each of those other boids, we also have to do 3 measurements. So the number of calculations
			is 3x3, aka 3². This means the simulation has a big-O notation of N², so the time it takes to
			simulate increases with the square of the number of boids.
		</p>
		<p>
			With two boids present you can see that generally one ends up following behind the other. This is mainly
			because the simulation is setup so that a boid can't see behind itself. So from the perspective of the boid
			infront, it doesn't have anything to follow, and will just continue straight while the others will follow
			along behind.
